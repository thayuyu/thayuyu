Yunes El Hamad here! 
I'm currently a student in the following schools: FMZ Luzern and BBZW Sursee

I am studying computer science and really enjoy working with a pc / laptop. In my free time I like to go workout or stay at home playing or working at small projects. I am a good team memeber and can manage a team well.
Logical thinking and problem solving are not things I lack, I can easily get my idea across with easy to understand explanations and documentations.
